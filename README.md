# Java
Java review & self-study

I am currently reviewing Java in preparation for C482-Software I at WGU. To achieve this, I am completing exercises borrowed from [here](https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html).

02/12/19 - I have begun reading __Introduction to Programming in Java__ by Sedgewick & Wayne. As I come across topics that are new to me, I will include the relevant exercises here.
